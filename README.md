Predicted the effect of mutated MAPK/ERK pathway activity on JAK/STAT pathway


The expression data input is the folder “expression”. This folder contains bulk RNA sequencing
gene expression data for 19 cancer types. These files contain both normal sample gene
expression and cancer sample gene expression.
The mutation data input is in the folder “mutation”. This folder contains the mutation type and
information for 19 cancer types by gene. This does not contain gene expression data, it is solely
mutation information.
The pathway network graph inputs is the file called “string_interactions2_1211”. This file consists
of a network of genes developed from StringDB. We chose these genes to represent the
MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT signaling pathways.
The script to run our final project is called “BMCS4480 Sundar Guruswamy Final Code.ipynb”.
The only adjustment you will have to do is to change the path information when calling one of
the above files.
We have also opted to include the “BMCS4480 Sundar Guruswamy Final Code.html” file with
our outputs.
This code can be run on Python through Jupyter Lab.
